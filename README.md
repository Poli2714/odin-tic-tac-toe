# Tic Tac Toe Game

This Tic Tac Toe project, part of **The Odin Project** curriculum, showcases my proficiency in web development using **HTML**, **CSS**, and vanilla **JavaScript**. Leveraging the concept of factory functions, I implemented the game's logic and design, providing an interactive and engaging user experience.

Advanced AI with Minimax Algorithm:
In addition to the fundamental game mechanics, this project features an advanced AI opponent powered by the minimax algorithm. The AI is designed to make optimal moves, providing a challenging experience for players. Explore the code to see how I integrated this powerful algorithm into the game.

Feel free to play a few rounds of Tic Tac Toe and challenge yourself against the minimax-powered AI! ðŸŽ®
